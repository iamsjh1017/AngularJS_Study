<!-- 
CSS Classes
	AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states.
	
	The following classes are added to, or removed from, input fields:
	
		ng-untouched 	The field has not been touched yet
		ng-touched 		The field has been touched
		ng-pristine		The field has not been  modified yet
		ng-dirty 		The field has been modified
		ng-valid 		The field content is valid
		ng-invalid 		The field content is not valid
		ng-valid-key 	One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
		ng-invalid-key 	Example: ng-invalid-required
		
	The following classes are added to, or removed from, forms:
	
		ng-pristine 	No fields has not been modified yet
		ng-dirty 		One or more fields has been modified
		ng-valid 		The form content is valid
		ng-invalid 		The form content is not valid
		ng-valid-key 	One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
		ng-invalid-key 	Example: ng-invalid-required
		
	The classes are removed if the value they represent is false.
	
	Add styles for these classes to give your application a better and more intuitive user interface.

<form name="myForm">
<p>Try writing in the input field:</p>

<input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>

<p>The input field requires content, and will therefore become green when you write in it.</p>
<p>The form gets a "ng-dirty" class when the form has been modified, and will therefore turn pink.</p>

</form>
