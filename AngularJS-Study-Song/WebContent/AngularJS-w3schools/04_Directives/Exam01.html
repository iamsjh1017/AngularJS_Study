AngularJS Directives
	AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.
	AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.
	AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.
	
AngularJS Directives
	AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.
	The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.
	The ng-init directive initializes application data.
	The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
	
The ng-app Directive
	The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.
	The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.
	
The ng-init Directive
	The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.
	Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead.
	
The ng-model Directive
	The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
	The ng-model directive can also:
		Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
		Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
		Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
		Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
