<!-- 
Know Your Scope
	It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.
	In the two examples above there is only one scope, so knowing your scope is not an issue, 
	but for larger applications there can be sections in the HTML DOM which can only access certain scopes.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="x in names">{{x}}</li>
</ul>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);

app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.names = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
});
</script>

<p>The variable "x" has a different value for each repetition, proving that each repetition has its own scope.</p>
