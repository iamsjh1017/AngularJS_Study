<!-- 
Understanding the Scope
	If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:
		View, which is the HTML.
		Model, which is the data available for the current view.
		Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
	Then the scope is the Model.
	The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1>My name is {{name}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.name = "John Doe";
});
</script>

<p>When you change the name in the input field, the changes will affect the model, and it will also affect the name property in the controller.</p>
