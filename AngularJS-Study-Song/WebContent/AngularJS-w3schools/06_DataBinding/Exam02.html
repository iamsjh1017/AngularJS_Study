<!-- 
HTML View
	The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view.
	The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view.
	You can use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property:
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p ng-bind="firstname"></p>
    <p>{{lastname}}</p>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.firstname = "John";
    $scope.lastname = "Doe";
});
</script>

<p>Use the ng-bind directive to bind the innerHTML of an element to a property in the data model.</p>
